This repo contains the CASA-based imaging pipeline for uGMRT data. This is especially tuned to carry out imaging in subbands and estimate the flux density of the spurce at the phase centre.

There are some parameters that need to be set-up and/or fine tuned in order to carry out imaging with the data acquired in different bands of the uGMRT.

The subband_stable script is the latest working version and the mps_dev is the script under developement and testing.
